      <h2>What is a cell? </h2>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>Cells are the <b> smallest component of all organisms. </b>  They allow us to live.  Cells handle functions such as processing foods, providing structure, and for plants, they even perform photosynthesis.  The term cell was first coined by English scientist Robert Hooke, who compared the cells to the cells found in monasteries.  
        </p>
      
      <p> There are three core components in <b>cell theory.</b> </p>

      <p>
        1.   All organisms are composed of one or more cells.

      </p>
      <p>
        2.   The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.   All cells come from preexisting cells.
      </p>

      <h2>Plant Cell Organelles</h2>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>Cell organelles are the various parts of the cell.  Each organelle performs its own function for the cell.
      </p>
      <p>On the outside of the cell is the <b>cell membrane.</b> The membrane is composed of a semi-permeable phospholipid bilayer.  The cell membrane supports and protects the cell, and is also responsible for determining what can enter or leave the cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Cell walls</b> are also found on the outside of the plant cell.  Like the membrane, the cell wall supports and protects the cell.  The cell wall also gives the plant cell its rectangular shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the membrane, there is a jelly-like substance known as the <b>cytoplasm.</b> 
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for the plant to perform photosynthesis, the plant must have chlorophyll.  This chlorophyll is found in the <b>chloroplasts</b> of the plant cell.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the cell, there is a series of tubes called the <b>endoplasmic reticulum</b>.  There are smooth tubes, containing no ribosomes, and rough tubes, containing ribosomes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Golgi bodies</b> move materials inside and outside of the cell.  These bodies process and package the proteins from the ribosomes.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Golgi bodies also build vesicles known as <b>lysosomes. </b> These lysosomes break down excess and worn out organelles/food and convert them into molecules.  Lysosomes also swallow viruses and bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>mitochondria</b>, the powerhouse of the cell, produces energy using cellular respiration.  The mitochondria is rod-shaped and is located around the cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>nucleus</b> controls and directs the activities of the cell. It also controls growth and reproduction of cells. The membrane of the nucleus allows materials to pass through.  The nucleus also contains DNA to determine traits and contains the <b>nucleolus</b>, the dark central ball. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In a cell, there are thousands of freely floating ribosomes.  These ribosomes create proteins that build structures, perform reparations, and conduct chemical reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plant cells also contain one large vacuole.  This helps it maintain shape, store essential nutrients, and remove waste.  
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Plant Cells</h2>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>Ground tissue, the tissue that makes up the majority of the plant body,  is composed of three main types of plant cells: parenchymal, collenchymal, and sclerenchyma.  </p>

      <p>Parenchymal cells are loosely-packed cubes.  They have thin walls and also contain chloroplasts.  These cells are responsible for photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and storage.</p>

      <p>Elongated cells with asymmetrically thick walls are collenchymal cells.   Collenchymal cells provide support and help with wind resistance.</p>

      <p>Sclerenchyma cells have extremely thick cell walls.  These cell walls contain lignin and provide support and strength. </p>
